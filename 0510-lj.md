# Day 3 - Frustration

Today was really frustrating. It's not the first time I've struggled with code, but trying to do something that I thought I already knew how to do was very frustrating.

The specific problem I was facing was that I couldn't resolve a while statement with two conditions. Even though I knew that the while loop could break, and console logs were showing that the variables that I needed to break the loop were resolving, the loop would not break out it.

This is a literal metaphor for my life. I know it works, but it doesn't work. Guess I don't know loops that well.

Interacting with the TAs are a little frustrating as well. The same people go to them for answers and use up most of the time. Even more frustrating is that if I have a question, most of the time, they don't know the answer. Maybe I need better questions.
