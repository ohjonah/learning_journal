# I AM TITANIUM

This week has been a hard week. We've learned foundational tenants of javascript and have had to synthesize the different layers of what goes into developing a front-end, in its most primitive state.

We've learned to:
1. Capture an element.
2. Add an action to the element.
3. Use javascript to initiate when the action is called on.

These past few days have been nice to ramp back down. To digest.

The other thing that has stuck with me this week was the quasi-"career" talk we had and the TEDx video from our homework. Both talked about inner-self and the ability to push through - whether this meant grit, self-efficacy, or not yet. Although I generally don't like these, 'you-can-do-everything-you-put-your-mind-to' talks, I did find solace in the idea that I have been able to do this, with or without the talks. I am glad that the 'can-do' attitude has been cemented through the past couple years.


It's been said, probably by Einstein or Vogue, 'The hardest steel is forged in the hottest fires.' Maybe Titanium. I like Ti better.
