# Apparently We Had Homework

With project week fully underway, it's been all about the project, project, project. I'm trying to facilitate my group. I can't tell if they have a handle on what's going on or if they understand how hard it is to bring a project together. Only time, i.e. Friday, will tell if we can finish this on time. Hopefully everyone hustles as much as I am trying to right now.
