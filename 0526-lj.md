# Home Stretch

I can taste the end. This class has been a whirlwind. Brian said today felt like yesterday and 6 months at the same time. That's exactly how I feel.

We did a recap today of all the things we learned. I have come a long way. One thing that I've noticed is that when I don't know what to do, I ask myself, "What do I need?". That has single handedly helped how I have coded.

When I approach a problem, I look for the minimum requirements, and then I wonder, "What else do I need?", then build accordingly. If this is anything like music, I need to keep on practicing, keep on practicing, and also keep on practicing. 

I think this will be the way to success.
