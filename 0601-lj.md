# Light at the end of the Tunnel

I got most of the code up and running. I'm really proud of my contributions. I worked really hard, troubleshooted other peoples code and made it better. I don't know if my group members got the same experience that I did though.

One thing that I wish we did better was segment the work more. So building out modality, not functionality. That would have been an interesting exercise, although I think a singular designer would have been good fro the front-front end of things.

I really enjoyed the connecting process. Making sure that all our code worked with each others code. But for now, I'm glad that tomorrow's the end.

I'm tired.
