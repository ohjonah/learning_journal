# Day 5 - Rinse, Wash, Repeat.

Since Day 3, I've come back up. I'm realizing that function aren't supposed to be these elaborate things. They are only there to provide containers for code. They are like the Ziplocs of javascript - I can keep what I want in it and reuse them as needed. People do that right?

Let's recap.

Thursday was a very interesting day. We did pair programming. That was an interesting experience. I didn't really like it at first. In the beginning, I felt like I had to code down because there were some concepts I innately understood more than my partner. However, it turned out to be a great learning experience for me, because whether I thought we worked well together or not, we still had to ship code. So at the end of our driver/nav session, we shipped our code. Sometimes you have to do it, not the best way, but the way that it works. And...to be fair, it's only day 4. I probably kept him back too.

Friday was recap day. I felt much stronger today. On Wednesday, I had reached out to some of my dev friends and they all expressed that the joy was in the problem solving. They all mentioned that I should stay calm, break down the problem, and talk through concepts with people. It'll cement. So, that's what I did today. As I'm sitting at home writing this, I feel like I have a grasp of functions and, for a top view,what they are and how they work.

I can't wait until objects next week. I know I'm going to struggle, but...I'm excited.
