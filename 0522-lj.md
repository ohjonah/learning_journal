# Frustrated
I am frustrated. I hit another roadblock. It's like I'm incapable of learning this material or even breaking down problems. I'm worried about the final project. If I can't even do this, how can I contributed a meaningful portion to my group?

I hope that something clicks over the next few days, but I hate turning in assignments that are incomplete.

But I can't help it.
