# i can't feel my face
It was a busy weekend. I mean busy. I coded for a significant portion of Saturday and read for the better portion of Sunday.

Today was a good class. I feel like I'm keeping up with the pace and learning so many new concepts. I was reminded today that it might be better to get the code out; so my goal and resolve is going to make sure that I can work to make the code work first, and then work on efficiency. I always want to do things better, but if I don't take the first step, then I can't make it better. So I will always make sure to ship before I am paralyzed by the analysis, AKA Analysis Paralysis.

There's a part of me that feels like I'm not doing good enough though. I've read about imposter syndrome, but never thought it would catch up to me. After all, I was going to be myself. Do my own thing. And yet, when I look at some of my peers work, I think to myself, 'Am I really that behind?'. It's easy to compare myself to others, but really I should be comparing myself to me.

The law of compounding interest is my advantage, and as long as I'm 1% better than yesterday, I shouldn't worry about my peers or the future.
