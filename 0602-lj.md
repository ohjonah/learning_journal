# Que Sera, Sera

It's done. Finally done.

As I reflect on how quickly this month has flown by, I can't help but realize that I have learned quite a bit. Let me see if I can recap.

* HTML
  * layout
  * elements and their attributes
* CSS
  * how to manipulate the box model
  * why things shift the way they do
* Javascript
  * loops
  * functions
  * objects
  * object constructors
  * DOM manipulation
  * localStorage

I realize you can do so much with what we learned. We are web developers!
