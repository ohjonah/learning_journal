# Monday Funday

Monday was exceptionally grueling. Tuesday and Wednesday seemed more plug and play. I also got to clean up my code quite a bit. I can't wait for tomorrow because we are going to be doing, what I would consider "stretch goals" with the code that we have been implementing.

I have noticed that there is an importance in maintaining clean code. When I wrote the first iteration of Bus Mall, I had a lot of extraneous information. But as I started getting a little more confident in using constructors, and not needing as many variables, I found that my code became more organized and troubleshooting became a breeze.

I've also taken Brian's advice and made everything that I can into functions. Sure, I have a bunch of functions, but I know exactly what they do, and it makes troubleshooting a breeze. Not only that, but I can now call those functions at any point, so I can add features on top without having to always refactor my code.

I have to start working harder on using prototype functions. I think I will have to practice.
