# Code 201 - LJ Day 2

tl;dr - Even though I feel like we're doing what we did in the pre-work, I like what we're doing, I like the review of material, and I hope to learn more soon. I can't wait until objects. I also hope my ego doesn't get in the way of asking for help.


I have had so much fun learning the foundational elements of coding. Even though making alerts and prompt boxes are akin to troll-like behavior, I have enjoyed starting to think through how to piece code together and how the interpreter goes line by line to execute my data.

It has also been really awesome learning more about git. I'm glad that we learned ACP, because that really broke it down and helped me realize that it's all about getting files ready to store at a remote location.

I can already tell that CSS is going to be a challenge. I can't wait for the CSS talk because it seems like, to do really really cool things, like things you see in CodePen, it's going to take some time. I'm willing to work at it.

So far, everything we've been learning has been a re-hash of what we've read or the pre-work. I think next week, it will pick up.

Classmates have been awesome, and hopefully we'll be able to work together to make an awesome final project.
