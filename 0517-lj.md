# From Death Into Life

The past few days have been a rollercoaster. I've seen some highs and I've seen some lows. I have been really frustrated, but today I had a turn.

When I first saw today's lab, I felt overwhelmed. I couldn't meet all the technical requirements, and to some degree, I haven't been able to wrap my brain around a few concepts. However, it's starting to come to fruition.

I'm sure I will go through many more of this valleys and hills.

One observation that I had was with the advent of objects, I noticed that I have less variables I need to use. So I end up saving a bunch of room because I don't need to store things due to instantiating new objects that store the information that I want.
